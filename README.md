# Password-Generator

## Description

A random password generator that can include upper case and lowercase letters as well as numbers and special characters. You can choose the length of your password between 8-128 characters. Dialogue boxes take you through choosing the parameters for your password and generates the password in the box on the page.

### Skills Used

In this assignment I used dialogue boxes to include selected criteria in our randomly generated password. The boxes collect the information for the password and each is validated in order to ensure proper characters are included. If no input is selected an alert box will show up telling you to select at least one input and redirects you to the beginning.
